# 🧪 juniorpen01's Test

juniorpen01's C/C++ testing framework. It's incredibly awesome because I, the great juniorpen01, made everything from scratch.

## Build Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**

    * **Git >= 2.39.5**
    * **CMake**
    * **A C compiler**
        <!-- Likely subject to change -->
        * ⚠️ **MSVC** will **not** work due to the lack of support for compiler-specific features like `__attribute__` and `_Generic`.
        * **Clang >= 14.0.6** is recommended especially if you plan to contribute.
        * **GCC** should work just as well.

2. **Quick Start**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/juniorpen01/c-juniorpen01s-test
    cd c-juniorpen01s-test
    ```
